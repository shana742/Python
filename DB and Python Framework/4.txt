4) What is Django URLs? make program to create django urls ?

-> django urls are used to route HTTP requests to the approprite views. the URL configuration maps URLs to viiews
   and is defined in python code. Each Django project has a main 'urls.py' file, and each app can also have its 
   own 'urls.py' file to handle app-   specific routing.

=> programm

   ==> mysite/urls.py:
        from django.contrib import admin
        from django .urls import ath, include
    
        urlpatterns = [
              path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
              path('',include('myapp.urls')),
        ]


    ==> myapp/urls.py 
          from django.urls import path
          from import views
    
          urlpatterns = [
              path('',views.home,name='home'),
              path('about/',views.about,name='about'),
          ]


    ==>  Views ( handle requests and return response).

           from django.shortcuts import render
           def home(request):
               return render(request, 'home.html')
           def about(request):
               return render(request, 'about.html')
