5) What is a QuerySet?Write program to create a new Post object in database:

-> A QuerySet in django represents a collection of object from your database. it allows you to retireve , 
   filter, order, and    manipukate the data in your databse in a pythonic way. QuerySets are typically 
   obtained by querying models manger and they are    lazy, meaning that no database action occurs until 
   the queryset is evaluted.

-> Example 
   
   => creting new postobject in the database
       - from django.db import models
          class Post(models.Model):
                title = models.CharField(max_length=255)
                content = models.TextField()

                def __str__(self):
                    return self.title

   =>views 
     
     from .models import postobject

     def create_post(request):
        post = Post.objects.create(title="my post",content=" This pst breief")
        return (f"'{post.title}' created susefully ")
