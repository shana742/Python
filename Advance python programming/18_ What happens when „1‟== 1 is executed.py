# What happens when „1‟== 1 is executed?

# the code ''1' == 1' compare the string ''1''to the integer '1'.because the types dont match the comparison
#evalutes to false.

# '1' : A string literal represting the charcter '1'.
# 1 : integer represting the numerica value 1
#== the equalit operator chcking if the teo sides are equal.

int('1') == 1

# this would evalute to True since both sides are now integers with same value.
